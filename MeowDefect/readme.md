Cat Taro has a string S. He wants to obtain the string "CAT" from the string S. 
In a single turn he can choose any character and erase all occurrences of this character in S. 
He can do as many turns as he wants (possibly zero).

You are given the String S. Return "possible" (quotes for clarity) if it is possible to obtain the string "CAT" and "Impossible" otherwise.

Method signature : String getAnswer(String S)
Constants
- S will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
- S will contain only uppercase English letters ('A'-'Z')
